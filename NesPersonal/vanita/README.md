#### Description:
In short: This is a web-based application that allows a user to purchase makeup from an online store.
Overall: I created HTML and CSS from scratch using the tips gained in the CS50 course, I also went through other courses and a crash course in HTML and CSS to create what I think is a great index, product, and contact page.

Also for the creation of the login and registration page, I used what we learned in the Nine of the CS50 Courses project. I used python and SQL to allow the user to create an account and use that account to navigate through the different pages of the web application.

I created the different Social Media icons with animation in HTML and Css, which will redirect to the Instagram and Whatsapp of the person who sells those products.

Next, for the shopping cart implementation I use different JavaScript functions to insert the product information to the HTML.

also, to give the functionality of adding the different products to the shopping cart, and updating the shopping cart every time the user clicks "add product"

I used JavaScript to create the window that appears after the user clicks the shopping cart icon and displays the products that the user previously added.

Lastly, I created a form on the contact page, which the user can fill out to send us an email, if they have any questions, and the submit button has a JavaScript alert added.
